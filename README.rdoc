= rgearmand

A ruby gearman server.

== Todo

* Choose a good persistent queue.
* Test the crap out of it.

== Plugins

Plugins can register themselves for:

* Options parsing through Rgearmand.options
* After-server initialization through Rgearmand.after_init
* Packet parsing for control messages through Rgearmand.packet_match / control_packet

== Note on Patches/Pull Requests
 
* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but
   bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
