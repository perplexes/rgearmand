Stuff that needs to be done:

* Foreground jobs logged to the DB 

* Add fields for:
** start time
** finish time
** status (ERROR, WARNING, SUCCESS, etc.)
** resulting data (data, exception, etc.)
** who picked it up (debugging help) 

* Display status of worker network
** Overall performance (run time averages per queue)
** Load average (1/5/10 minute load)

* Account stuff
** Billing / cost per job / balance, etc. 
** CRUD
** Chargify

* Job queues
** View a specific job 
** Visualize queue load (charts?)
** Error handling / re-enqueue work

* Double rainbow stuff:
** Recurring jobs (how many times? similar jobs? wtfhooptywagon?)
** Recurring queues -- user specifies a queue as recurring and a failure threshold up to which exponential backoff automatically happens
** SUBMIT_JOB_CRON
